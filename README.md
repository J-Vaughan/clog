# CLog gh-pages

This is the README for the GitHub Page for CLog.

## Requirements

To install the requirements, `bundle install`.

## Workflow

Every tag's code will be copied into `code`, and the various documentation will
be parsed using RedCarpet. This text will be (for now) manually copied into the
respective files. If the CSS has changed, compile the Sass into `site.css`.
